% Although we try to provide a template that completely
% matches the corresponding assignment, we do expect you
% to check that you have indeed answered all questions.
%

% ALSO VERY IMPORTANT:
% This is just a template to help you with the LaTeX part of the assignment.
% So you may change it completely according to your own wishes!
%

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
  % Typically the 'article' class is appropriate for assignments.
  % And we print it on a4, so we include that as well.
  
  \usepackage{a4wide}
  % To decrease the margins and allow more text on a page.
  
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  % To deal with including pictures.
  
  \usepackage{enumerate}
  % To provide a little bit more functionality than with LaTeX's default
  % enumerate environment.
  
  \usepackage{array} 
  % To provide a little bit more functionality than with LaTeX's default
  % array environment.
  
  \usepackage[american]{babel}
  % Use this if you want to write the document in US English. It takes care of
  % (usually) proper hyphenation.
  % If you want to write your answers in Dutch, please replace 'american'
  % by 'dutch'.
  % Note that after a change it may be that the first compilation of LaTeX
  % fails. That is normal and caused by the fact that in auxiliary files
  % from previous runs, there may still be a \selectlanguage{american}
  % around, which is invalid if 'american' is not incorporated with babel.
  
  \usepackage{amssymb}
  % This package loads mathematical things like the fonts for the blackboard
  % bold for the set of natural numbers.
  
  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \usepackage{clipboard}
  
  \newcommand{\exercise}[2]{\subsection*{Exercise #1}{#2}}
  \newcommand{\exerciseenum}[2]{\subsection*{Exercise #1}{\begin{enumerate}[a)]#2\end{enumerate}}}
  % We defined our own commands to make it easy to present all the
  % exercises in the same style. The first one does not automatically
  % start an 'enumerate' list, the second one does.
  % The [2] means that our command needs two arguments.
  % The #1 and the #2 indicate where we use these arguments in the
  % command.
  % There are several ways to have automatic numbering for the exercises,
  % but here we have chosen to use a subsection for this and use manual
  % numbering. This is because maybe not everyone will be able to do hand in
  % all exercises.
  % Note that we add the '*' to make sure that the subsection is not numbered.
  % (Since we don't have a \section, the numbers for a subsection would be
  % ugly like 0.1, 0.2 et cetera.
  % The environment 'enumerate' automatically numbers the items in this list.
  % The optional [a)] makes sure that the list will be like a), b), c) et cetera.
  
  
  \newcommand{\set}[1]{\ensuremath{\left\{{#1}\right\}}}
  % This command puts curly braces around its argument, so it becomes
  % a set. The \left and \right make sure that the braces grow in size
  % if the contents of the set are large symbols.
  
  \newcommand{\setbuild}[2]{\ensuremath{\set{{#1}\mid{#2}}}}
  % We also introduce a shortcut for using the set builder notation.
  % Do you understand what it does?
  
  % And the next series of commands gives you some of the default sets
  % that were in the slides.
  \newcommand{\TT}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{T}}}
  \newcommand{\FF}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}}
  \newcommand{\NN}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{N}}}
  \newcommand{\NNp}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{N}^{+}}}
  \newcommand{\ZZ}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}}}
  \newcommand{\ZZp}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}^{+}}}
  \newcommand{\QQ}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Q}}}
  \newcommand{\QQp}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{Q}^{+}}}
  \newcommand{\RR}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}}
  \newcommand{\RRp}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}^{+}}}
  \newcommand{\CC}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{C}}}
  
  % An the next command gives a shorthand for the power set of a given set.
  \newcommand{\power}[1]{\ensuremath{{\cal P}\left({#1}\right)}}
  
  \newcommand{\sol}[1]{\underline{\underline{#1}}}
  
  
  \title{Calculus and Probability\\Assignment 1}
  
  % Replace the placeholders by your real name, student number and 
  % group (for the exercise hours)
  \author{
  \global\Copy{name}{
   Brigel Pineti  % Fill in your name
  } \\ 
  \global\Copy{snumber}{
  s1005549  % Fill in your student number
  } }
  
  % In LaTeX everything before \begin{document} is called pre-amble.
  % This is where you put all important settings. The real document
  % starts after \begin{document}.
  \begin{document}
  \maketitle 
  % \maketitle makes sure that the title is shown on the first page of
  % the document.
  
  
  % Now we use the command we defined earlier and give it the proper two
  % parameters.
  % Because the second parameter is long, we put a % directly after the
  % opening curly brace {. This is not needed but makes the source file
  % look a bit better.
